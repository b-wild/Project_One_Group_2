What crimes are shown here?
All statistics presented in Crime Cards are based on preliminary DC Index crime 
data reported from 2009 up to a second before midnight today (that's 11:59:59 pm yesterday). 
They are compiled based on the date the offense was reported ( Report Date) to the police department. 
The date and time window of the crime’s occurrence is provided in the See a detailed list… card, 
but the reliability of these dates and times may vary considerably. The Crime Cards application 
displays two main crime categories: Violent Crime and Property Crime. Violent Crimes include homicide, 
sex abuse, assault with a dangerous weapon (ADW), and robbery. Violent crimes can be further searched by 
the weapon used: guns, non-guns, or either. Property Crimes include burglary, motor vehicle theft, 
theft from vehicle, theft (other), and arson. Please be aware that not all crime incidents may appear 
in the Crime Cards that may be listed in other resources (see FAQ on matching data below).
